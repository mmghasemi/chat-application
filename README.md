Video and Voice Chat Application With Jitsi
============

eXo Chat is an Instant Messaging application for eXo Platform 4.
Thanks to [Jitsi](http://www.jitsi.org) and their powerful videoBridge Module, itâ€™s even possible to benefit from Video Conferencing (One to One, Conference) and Screen Sharing from within eXo Chat.



Technically speaking, this Chat application comes with a client project (/application) and a server project (/server). All the Chat data is stored using MongoDB for storage.
Server can run on the same Java Application Server but as it's a near to real time application and can process a lot of data, it's recommended to use the Chat Server as a standalone application on another AS.
Thus, Chat Client portlets will run on an eXo Platform based App Server, where the Chat Server can run on a standard tomcat installation.
